USE 2 POINTERS FOR ALL NODES DATA STRUCTURES OPERATION


Binary search tree:
    • all the nodes in the left tree is less than or equal to the root node
    • all the nodes in the right tree is greater than or equal to the root node
BST Insert
    • create new node tmp with data
    • check for the root node; if none set it to tmp_node
    • set current node equal to root 
        ◦ while true
        ◦ set parent node(ptr2) equal to current, ie ptr2 =ptr1
        ◦ check if tmp.data < current.data;
            ▪ if true, set current = current.left_child 
            ▪ (now the current node is pointing to the left tree of the node)
            ▪ check if current (the updated current) is None; if true set parent.left_child (ie the parent is pointing to the unupdated current, ie the parent of the left sub tree) equal to tmp
        ◦ repeat the same for greater than equal to condition
            ▪ return to  the function to start a new call from somewhere
